# Olympic_medals
This is the project of Data Science and Machine Learning in which the goal is to predict the number of olympic medals a country can win by analysing the previous year datas and other parameters.
For this I used the python libraries pandas,numpy,seaborn and Machine Learning package sklearn.
After importing the dataset from the system, I used correlation function between our goal and the other parameters.
Plotting the graphs and histogram to visualise and for more insights from the raw data.
Checked for the null values and accordingly dropped them.
Then splited the data into train and test variables.
Used LinearRegression model of Supervised Machine Learning for the predictions.
Checked for error and used mean_absolute_error.
Then finally improved the model by taking other parameters and minimised the errors.
